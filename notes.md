# CMS Scripting

The latest version of the maps have been written to be easily expandable should there be new keybindings that need to be mapped. As a result all 128 CMS buttons are considered reserved, although not all 128 are mapped. In addition the first 48 CMS Axis are considered reserved, and you should avoid using them.

Since this can be rather limiting the following is breakdown of how likely unmapped axis and buttons are to be used.

##Â Axis

Axis                   | Note
---------------------- | ----
`CMS.A1` to `CMS.A3`   | In use
`CMS.A4`               | Reserved to use as a _Yaw_ axis
`CMS.A5`               | Reserved to use as a _Thrust_ axis
`CMS.A6` to `CMS.A8`   | Avoid, may get mapped in the future
`CMS.A9` to `CMS.A16`  | Unlikely to be used, but prefer use of `CMS.A49` and above
`CMS.A17` to `CMS.A19` | In use
`CMS.A20` to `CMS.A24` | Avoid, may get mapped in the future
`CMS.A25` to `CMS.A32` | Unlikely to be used, but prefer use of `CMS.A49` and above
`CMS.A33` to `CMS.A40` | Avoid, may get used by pedals in the future
`CMS.A41` to `CMS.A48` | Unlikely to be used, but prefer use of `CMS.A49` and above
`CMS.A49` to `CMS.A64` | Free to use
